The more readable CSS files are the .scss files. These files are sass, which is a version of CSS that adds some features which improve readability, structure ,and maintainability, these files still compile down the CSS.
The CSS files are still commented and have some structure to them, but the .scss files have a much better structure to them due to some features that SASS adds, mainly classes which allows this 

div {
    Some content 
} 

div img {
    CSS for the img in the div 
}

to be written as 

div {
    Some content 

    img { 
        CSS for the img in the div
    }
}
